# anisotropic-isotropic-laplace-gaussian

This is the code for the first four examples of Chapter 3 in Torben Sell's PhD thesis.

In four experiments, we compare the performance of the Moreau-Yosida Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (MY-ULA), the Moreau-Yosida Unadjusted Underdamped Langevin Algorithm (MY-UULA), the stochastic second kind orthogonal Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev method (SK-ROCK), the proximal Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (pMALA), the Bouncy-Particle Sampler (BPS), and the Zig-Zag Sampler (ZZS). The examples are three-dimensional distributions; an isotropic Laplace distribution, an anisotropic Laplace distribution, an isotropic Gaussian distribution, and an anisotropic Gaussian distribution. 

The thesis, which includes the relevant references for all algorithms, will be made available as soon as possible, in the meantime please reach out to me if you are interested in a draft version.
